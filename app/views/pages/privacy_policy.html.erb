      Article 6 (1)(a).
    </p>

    <h2 class='govuk-heading-l'>
      Who we will make your personal data available to
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We sometimes need to make personal data available to other organisations. These might include contracted partners (who
      we have employed to process your personal data on our behalf) and/or other organisations (with whom we need to share
      your personal data for specific purposes).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You must not misuse our service by knowingly introducing viruses, trojans, worms, logic bombs or other material
      that is malicious or technologically harmful. You must not attempt to gain unauthorised access to our service,
      the server on which our service is stored or any server, computer or database connected to our service. You must
      not attack our site via a denial-of-service attack or a distributed denial-of service attack. Each of these acts
      is a criminal offence. We will report any such offence to the relevant law enforcement authorities and co-operate
      with them to determine your identity.

        block it)
      </li>
      <li>
        to enable users to use the service and receive updates
      </li>
    </ul>
